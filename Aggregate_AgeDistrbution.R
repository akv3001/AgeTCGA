#Task: Go through all the clinical files and estimate the age distribution
# Notes/Updates


##########################


# Write a loop to iterate through the clinical files 
# Create a list object with each cancer type as adataframe object


# Compute the median and mean for each cancer type , the mix , max 
# also use a loop to do this by going through the list structure
# this should create a new dataframe summarized ( you did this manually in the excel originally but please execute same in code below)



# Append to dataframe above the median_younger/median_older columns 
#  this would be samples < median age , sample > median age
# same this for the mean_younger, mean_older



#you should end up with 2 object here a list object for the clinical table and dataframe summary to determine the group distributions
